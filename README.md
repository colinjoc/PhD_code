# PhD_code
Here is some commented code from various projects in my PhD.
I am trying to add commented code, this is a problem as I tended not to comment my code. I may add non-commented code, we'll see.

Added:
static_nwn: A well commmented code that highlights how nanowire networks are simulated and their electrical properties calculated. Check out my thesis for more info.

Multi terminal memristive NWNs: code to generate multi-terminal memristive networks, plot them and perform numerical simulations with them.

To Add:
Capacitive NWNs: looking for some decently commented code.
